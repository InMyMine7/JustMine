JustMine is a tools for grab domain from mirror website, zone-h, zonexsec, haxorid

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- The requests package (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)

## How To Usage 
- ppshid and zhe are auto stored in config.json, so you don't need to change zhe or ppshid, if you get chapta zoneh, you just put chapta in zoneh and take ppshid and put it in tools, without having to change anything in config json, easier right?
- zonexsec and haxorid don't need ppshid or anything, you can use it right away, for zonexsec it's a bit slow because of cloudflare.
